# 01_count_words

In this first simple exercise, you are tasked with writing a function that
counts the words in a block of text.

If you are wondering what qualifies as a word, simply have a look at the
"tests.cpp" file.

## How to proceed

In Visual Studio, right-click on 01_count_words (That's called the "project"),
and select "Set as startup project". This will make it so that when you click
the big green arrow in the toolbar (or press F5), this will be the executable
that runs. Do it now!

Visual studio will say the project needs to be built, so let it do it. Once it's
done building, the tests in tests.cpp will be run, and you will see that a bunch
of them are failing. You can double-click in the log to jump straight to the
failing test.

Your goal is simply to make it so that when you run, **all tests pass**. You can
do this by modifying the count_words.cpp file.

I have intentionally left out a bunch of details. You WILL have to ask me a
bunch of questions to pull this off, so do not hesitate.
